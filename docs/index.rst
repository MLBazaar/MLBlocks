MLBlocks is a simple framework for seamlessly combining any possible set of Machine Learning
tools developed in Python, whether they are custom developments or belong to third party
libraries, and build Pipelines out of them that can be fitted and then used to make predictions.

This is achieved by providing a simple and intuitive annotation language that allows the
user to specify how to integrate with each tool, here called primitives, in order to provide
a common uniform interface to each one of them.

At a high level:

* Each available primitive has been annotated using a standardized JSON file that specifies its
  native interface, as well as which hyperparameters can be used to tune its behavior.
* A list of primitives that will be combined into a pipeline is provided by the user, optionally
  passing along the hyperparameters to use for each primitive.
* An MLBlock instance is build for each primitive, offering a common interface for all of them.
* The MLBlock instances are then combined into an MLPipeline instance, able to run them all in
  the right order, passing the output from each one as input to the next one.
* The training data is passed to the `MLPipeline.fit` method, which sequentially fits each
  MLBlock instance following the JSON annotation specification.
* The data used to make predictions is passed to the `MLPipeline.predict` method, which uses each
  MLBlock sequentially to obtain the desired predictions.

History
-------

In its first iteration, in 2015, MLBlocks was designed for only multi table, multi entity temporal
data. A good reference to see our design rationale at that time is Bryan Collazoâ€™s thesis, written
under the supervision of Kalyan Veeramachaneni:

* `Machine learning blocks`_.
  Bryan Collazo. Masters thesis, MIT EECS, 2015.

In 2018, with recent availability of a multitude of libraries and tools, we decided it was time to
integrate them and expand the library to address other data types, like images, text, graph or
time series, as well as introduce the usage of deep learning libraries. A second iteration of our
work was then started by the hand of William Xue:

* `A Flexible Framework for Composing End to End Machine Learning Pipelines`_.
  William Xue. Masters thesis, MIT EECS, 2018.

Later in 2018, Carles Sala joined the project to make it grow as a reliable open-source library
that would become part of a bigger software ecosystem designed to facilitate the development of
robust end-to-end solutions based on Machine Learning tools. This third iteration of our work
was presented in 2019 as part of the Machine Learning Bazaar:

* `The Machine Learning Bazaar: Harnessing the ML Ecosystem for Effective System Development`_.

* Extensive documentation, including multiple pipeline examples.

0.2.0 - New MLBlocks API
------------------------

A new MLBlocks API and Primitive format.

This is a summary of the changes:

* Primitives JSONs and Python code has been moved to a different repository, called MLPrimitives
* Optional usage of multiple JSON primitive folders.
* JSON format has been changed to allow more flexibility and features:
    * input and output arguments, as well as argument types, can be specified for each method
    * both classes and function as primitives are supported
    * multitype and conditional hyperparameters fully supported
    * data modalities and primitive classifiers introduced
    * metadata such as documentation, description and author fields added
* Parsers are removed, and now the MLBlock class is responsible for loading and reading the
  JSON primitive.
* Multiple blocks of the same primitive are supported within the same pipeline.
* Arbitrary inputs and outputs for both pipelines and blocks are allowed.
* Shared variables during pipeline execution, usable by multiple blocks.
